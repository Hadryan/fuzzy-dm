# Introduction

This repo is a small PHP library to make multi criteria decisions. It is depended on fuzzy-logic fundamentals and uses simple [membership](https://bit.ly/2NLJIrs) and [agregate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_function) functions without any mathematical library. Using this library you can make decisions based on some predefined numeric features. For example you are manager of some basketball team and you want to make profitable guard transfer for the team and you have some specific requirements: you have limited transfer budget, have some range of weight, age or height, need maximally experienced and young player as possible. This example will be discussed above alongside with library methods and functions.
